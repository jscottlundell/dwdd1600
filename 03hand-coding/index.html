        <h1>Outer Darkness Paranormal</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Outer Darkness Paranormal</strong> began in 2013 as a passionate gathering of amateur ghost hunters who were more interested in the thrill of the unknown than in proving a point.
        What started as a few friends swapping spooky stories soon morphed into something more substantial.
        By 2016, the team had expanded and evolved into a well-oiled, highly skilled group of professionals.
        Our website launch marked the beginning of a new era of serious, respectful paranormal investigation, and since then, we’ve been on a relentless quest to uncover the unexplained.</p>

            </ul>
