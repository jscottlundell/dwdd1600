        <h1>About Us</h1>
        
        <p>We are Outer Darkness Paranormal (O.D.P.). We primarily focus on research of ghosts and demons in the central Utah area but have investigated locations across the U.S. and internationally. If you want to join us in our investigations, contact us <a href="contact.html">HERE!</a> Our goal is to capture evidence of ghosts with audio or video recording, or photographs. We do not use nonscientific methods like Ouija boards, dousing rods, seiances, etc that we consider to be too subjective.</p>

        <p>Surveys show that over 42% of American's believe in the existence of Ghosts, and 18% claim to have seen one. Our first hand experiences have led us to further investigations, and to creating this web site for sharing our findings and meeting with other investigators.</p>

        <p>Contrary to what you see on TV, not every investigation yields class A EVP's and demons calling us by name. That just isn't the way it works in the real world. Sometimes we pour through hours of data taken in a supposed hotbed of paranormal activity, only to find nothing. We may make mention of these investigations, but likely will not publish anything else from that session. After all, people don't visit this website looking for the ordinary.</p>
        
        <h1>Meet the Team</h1>
        
        <h2>Jefferson</h2>
            <p>After a long and distinguished military career, Jefferson hung up his boots and traded in his combat gear for a ghost-hunting kit. His battlefield now spans the eerie corridors of haunted houses and the shadowy corners of abandoned buildings, where he goes toe-to-toe with ghosts and demons rather than the Taliban. As the founder of Outer Darkness Paranormal (ODP), Jefferson has spent nearly 20 years honing his skills and indulging his passion for the paranormal.</p>
            <p>Jefferson’s leadership and expertise have been instrumental in shaping ODP into the renowned team it is today. Whether he's setting up high-tech equipment or sharing a well-timed ghost story, his experience and enthusiasm infuse every investigation with a sense of adventure and respect. </p>
        
        <h2>Sean</h2>
            <p>Sean had always had a knack for staring into the abyss. As an Air Force Cop, he’d spent countless hours peering into the dark, waiting for something—anything—to break the stillness of the night. But now, with his degrees in Anthropology and Folklore and Film and Media, he was trading his military-grade night vision for the softer glow of research lamps and camera screens.</p>
            <p>With his blend of expertise, wit, and a touch of irreverence, Sean was ready for whatever might emerge from the shadows. After all, whether it’s folklore or film, the real fun begins when the unexpected steps into the spotlight.</p>
        
        <h2>Nate</h2>
            <p>Meet Nate, the team’s resident geek and our go-to tech wizard. Nate earned his PhD from the prestigious Jerry Rig University, where he majored in Soldering with a minor in Gadgetry. His skill with a soldering iron is so legendary, we half-expect him to turn up at our next investigation with a gadget that runs on sheer willpower and duct tape.</p>
            <p>When he’s not tinkering with his latest top-secret inventions, Nate’s probably in his lab, surrounded by a chaos of wires, circuit boards, and mysterious gizmos that might just be the key to solving our paranormal conundrums. He’s working on some seriously cool tools that promise to revolutionize our ghost-hunting game, and we’re all on the edge of our seats to see what he comes up with next.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for updates on Nate’s cutting-edge creations. Who knows? The next big thing might be a ghost-detector that doubles as a coffee maker or a spectral tracker that fits in your pocket. Whatever it is, it’s bound to be as inventive and quirky as Nate himself.</p>
